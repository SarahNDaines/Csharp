does C# have mutating methods?
is modulo the remainder or just like the remainder?
how are string and char different?
- can you use the same string methods on chars as strings?
- should if curly braces be on the next line?
  - I tried with curly braces starting on the same line and it worked, might be a syntax question
if (...) {

}

vs

if (...)
{

}
