Classes:
--------------------
- Can define in the Program class, but not inside main
- can also define in a separate file named the same as the class name
- class names are normally PascalCase?
- instantiate a new instance of class using new keyword
  - instances are of the type of the class
  - in the example below f is an instance of Forest
  - f also has a type Forest

example
---
class Forest {
}

Forest f = new Forest();

- data in an object is called fields
- it is one type of a class member
- below the value of name and trees aren't set so they have default values
    - int default value is 0
    - string default value is null  
    - bool default value is false
- use lowercase to name fields
- fields can be accessed and set using dot notation

class Forest {
  public string name;
  public int trees;
}

- properties are another type of class member
    - has two methods get() and set()
    - can use getter and setter for validation
    - common to name the property the uppercase version of the field
    - set uses keyword value, this represents the value passed as arg

public int area;
public int Area
{
  get { return area; }
  set { area = value; }
}

    - using setter for validation

public int Area
{
  get { return area; }
  set 
  { 
    if (value < 0) { area = 0; }
    else { area = value; }
  }
}

- automatic property
    - we can default the getter and setters with no other logic using the following

public string size;
public string Size
{
  get { return size; }
  set { size = value; }
}

    - becomes the following 
        - note that we don't define the field size separately

public string Size
{ get; set; }

- Acess modifiers
    - using public for the fields makes it so they can access the properties directly without use the getter and setter 
    - public member can be accessed by any class
    - private can only be accessed by code in the same class
    - classes default to public
    - class members default to private
    - can set get() or set to private or just not define

public int Area
{
  get { return area; }
  private set { area = value; }  
}

- class methods
    - define a method in a class similar to how methods are defined normally
    - remember that to use getter and setter you use the property which is capitalized to get and set the value
    - you can use += and -= with properties and fields

class Forest {
  public int Area
  { /* property body omitted */  }
  public int IncreaseArea(int growth)
  {
    Area = Area + growth;
    return Area;
  }
}

- class constructors
    - called when a new object is created
    - used to initialize values for the instance
    - no return type
    - name is same as the class
    - if no constructor is defined a parameterless constructor is created and used

    class Forest
{
  public int Area;
 
  public Forest(int area)
  {
    Area = area;
  }
}

- this keyword
    - use to avoid code like `Area = area;`
    - which is ambigous
    - refer to the current instance 

class Forest
{
  public int Area
  { /* property omitted */ }
 
  public Forest(int area)
  {
    this.Area = area;
  }
}

- Overloading
    - like other methods we can also overload constructors
    - usefull to define different method signatures

public Forest(int area, string country)
{ 
  this.Area = area;
  this.Country = country;
 }

public Forest(int area)
{ 
  this.Area = area;
  this.Country = "Unknown";
}

- Default arguments version C# > 4.0
    - can use default arguments when overloading to reduce the amount of code to change with updates

public Forest(int area, string country = "Unknown")
{
  this.Area = area;
  this.Country = country;
}

- Can also use :this() with version C# <= 4.0
    - used to refer to another constructor in the same class
    - the arguments types and order still has to match.
    - basically  like super in Ruby
 
 public Forest(int area, string country)
{ 
  this.Area = area;
  this.Country = country;
}

public Forest(int area) : this(area, "Unknown")
{ 
  Console.WriteLine("Country property not specified. Value defaulted to 'Unknown'.");
}

- Static
    - means associated with the class, not instance
    - comes after the access modifire of the class member
    - accessing using dot notation with the class name not the instance name
        - f.definition would raise an error

class Forest
{
  private static string definition;
  public static string Definition
  { 
    get { return definition; }
    set { definition = value; }
  }
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
  Console.WriteLine(Forest.Definition);
}

    - can also add static to a method
        - can only access static members

class Forest
{
  private static string definition;
  public static void Define()
  { 
    Console.WriteLine(definition); 
  }
}

    - can also create static constructors
        - run once before class is created
        - run before an instance is made from the class
        - and before static members are accessed
        - can't use access modifier with static constructors

class Forest 
{
  static Forest()
  { /* ... */ }
}

    - can create static classes
        - can't instantiate from a static class
        - usefull for utility classes like Math or Console
        - they are tools, they don't store specific information

Math.Min(34, 54);
Console.WriteLine("yeehaw!");

- Static Errors
    - using access modifier with static constructor
error CS0515: 'Forest.Forest()': static constructor cannot have an access modifier

    - trying to reference a non static member from a class
error CS0120: An object reference is required to access non-static field, method, or property 'Forest.Grow()'

    - trying to reference a static member from an instance instead of the class
error CS0176: Member 'Forest.TreeFacts' cannot be accessed with an instance reference; qualify it with a type name instead

- Main() method
    - method of the Program class
    - public: can be called outside the program class
    - static: called using class name instead of instance
    - void: doesn't return a value
    - one argument `string[] args`
        - array of strings
    - dotnet run calls the Main() method
    - can pass arguments to main after the command

class Program
{
  public static void Main (string[] args) 
  {
  }
}

dotnet run mango pineapple lychee
// passes ["mango", "pineapple", "lychee"] to main method
